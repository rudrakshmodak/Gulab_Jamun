For Preparing Sugar Syrup: In a saucepan, add sugar, water, crushed cardamom, saffron, lemon juice and boil together until the sugar syrup becomes slightly sticky. Turn off the heat.

For Preparing Gulab Jamun: In a bowl, add milk powder, all purpose flour, baking soda and mix well.

Add ghee and mix well. Add milk little by little and knead a soft dough (do not over knead a dough). 

Divide the dough into small portions and roll into the smooth small size balls without leaving any cracks. Gulab jamun expands in its size when frying and soaking in the hot sugar syrup.

Deep fry in the oil over a low to medium heat until golden brown and drain out the excess oil from the gulab jamuns. 

Add to the hot sugar syrup immediately when the fried gulab jamun is still hot and soak for a couple of hours. Serve gulab jamun with a spoon full of sugar syrup.
